**Website:** http://wasteland.expert <BR>
**Devblog:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout13 <BR>
**Code:** https://github.com/MadBay/mbv113 <BR>

##Attention!
Thanks to the laborious efforts of Byond maintenance team, and drastic changes while working on creation of Byond version 510, the build became incompatible with 510, due to several changes in scripts and other things we can't manage to edit. <BR>
**How to make it work then?!** <BR>
Just use one of the older Byond versions, you will be able to host the game on Byond 509 or less, while players will be able to join from any other higher version of Byond. <BR>
We suggest you to use the version 508.1299, as it's the version with best compatibility with the build source code. <BR>
You can get any of previous editions of Byond engine at [official Byond versions archive](http://www.byond.com/download/build/). <BR>
Also you can [get Byond 508.1299](http://www.byond.com/download/build/508/) for the best gaming experience. <BR>
